To reference the current session user ID, the variable name is "currentUserID"
without the quotation marks, also to call it in any of the pages, you must start
a session first, session_start(); with this you can refer it with $_SESSION['currentUserID'];

Sample Pseudocode
DATABASE CONNECTION
hostname = 'localhost'
user = 'root'
password = none
database_name = 'habit-db'

# Connect to the database
connection = mysqli_connect(hostname, user, password, database_name)

# If the connection fails, output an error
if(!connection)
    die("Error, connection failed with 'database_name'" + mysqli_connect_error())

CREATE
habit_name = input['habit_name']
repetition_type = input['repetition_type']
custom_interval = input['custom_interval']
week_day = input['week_day']

switch(repetition_type)
	case weekly:
		modified weekly habit query
	case custom:
		modified custom habit query
	default:
		default habit query
# Execute the sql to the database
execute = mysqli_query(connection, habit_query)

READ
# Collect all client type users and exclude those whose accounts are deleted
user_query = "SELECT ALL FROM users WHERE type = 'client' AND deleted_at IS NULL"
users = mysqli_query(connection, user_query)
# Iterate every rows found in the executed query
while(users = mysqli_fetch_assoc)
    echo table tag
        echo table data users['username']
        echo table data users['password']
        echo table data users['phonenumber']
    echo table closing tag

UPDATE
# Run through some checks before continuing, return if one check fails
if (password strength < weak) return
if (new password != confirm password) return

# Create a query and execute it
update_query = "UPDATE users SET password = new password WHERE username = input_username"
update = mysqli_query(connection, update_query)

DELETE
# Set the habit deleted at todays current timestamp
delete_query = "UPDATE habits SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = selected_habit_id"
delete = mysqli_query(connection, delete_query)
